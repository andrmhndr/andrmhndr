### Development Philosophy

> “I believe that software should be both **elegant** and **functional**. Writing great code is not just about syntax—it's about structure, foresight, and purpose.”

- Efficient code is better than clever code.
- Clear naming and documentation reduce technical debt.
- Innovation thrives when constraints are respected.
